# viola-jones

Rust implementation of the face detection algorithm by Viola and Jones. Because
this was implemented in a class, I used lower-level primitives than what might
otherwise be ideal (eg. PistonDevelopers/image instead of
PistonDevelopers/imageproc, which is included but only used for non-essential
tasks).
